      <p>BeCool is a student project started with the aim to decrease food insecurity and food waste in Canada by not
        only raising awareness of community fridges in the greater Vancouver area,
        but also by facilitating the accessibility and contribution of food to those fridges. We aim to equip users with
        the ability to visualize food resources donated by the community
        from the comfort of their homes, so those suffering from food scarcity and insecurity are not only made aware of
        available fresh food nearby,
        but are also able to plan their routes and meals.
        To those with resources to give, we aim to help ease the process of locating available spaces
        nearby as well as keeping track of donations that could have otherwise become foodwaste in their homes. </p>

    <div class="section-content">
      <p>Community food storages are exactly what they sound like,
        these sptorages are put in place by the community where people donate what they can,
        and take what they need. These locations work on an honor system and are widely
        regarded as a judgement free zone. Our app provides a way to track the food in
        the community food storages so people may know how long food has been sitting there for,
        and so that a hopeful trip is not wasted upon arrival of an empty fridge or pantry.</p>
