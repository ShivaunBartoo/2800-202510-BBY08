      <p>BeCool is a student project started with the aim to decrease food insecurity and food waste in Canada by not
        only raising awareness of community fridges in the greater Vancouver area,
        but also by facilitating the accessibility and contribution of food to those fridges. We aim to equip users with
        the ability to visualize food resources donated by the community
        from the comfort of their homes, so those suffering from food scarcity and insecurity are not only made aware of
        available fresh food nearby,
        but are also able to plan their routes and meals.
        To those with resources to give, we aim to help ease the process of locating available spaces
        nearby as well as keeping track of donations that could have otherwise become foodwaste in their homes. </p>

      <span>What is Community Food Storage?</span>

    <div class="section-content">
      <p>Community food storages are exactly what they sound like: places set up by the community where people can
        donate what they can and take what they need. These locations operate on an honor system and are widely regarded
        as judgment-free zones.

        Our app helps track the contents of these community food storages, allowing users to see how long items have
        been there. This ensures that a hopeful visit isn’t wasted by arriving at an empty fridge or pantry.</p>
