        <h1>What is BeCool?</h1>
        <p>
            BeCool is a community-driven sharing platform that fights food insecurity and food waste by
            promoting equal access to healthy food through public community fridges. Whether you're donating
            surplus produce, picking up essentials, or sparking conversations about food systems, BeCool
            empowers neighbors to GIVE, TAKE, and SHAREâ€”building stronger, more connected communities through
            shared food, stories, and ideas.
